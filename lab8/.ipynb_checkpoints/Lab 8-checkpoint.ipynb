    "8. (20 points) A common question in data science is to try and determine if there is a difference between two groups. For instance, we might wonder if the sex of the passenger on the Titanic affected whether or not they survived. We will explore this question here. One method for establishing a relationship is the following:\n",
    "        \n",
    "     + Randomly divide pick a subset of 314 observations. (The number of women on board the titanic) \n",
